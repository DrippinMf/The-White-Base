        <h1>Introduction</h1>
        <h2>What is Gunpla?</h2>
        <h3>Gunpla, short for Gundam Plastic Models are model kits depicting the vehicles and characters of the fictional Gundam multiverse by Bandai.</h3>
        <h3>These kits became popular among mecha anime fans and model enthusiasts in Japan and nearby Asian countries beginning in the 1980s. Gundam modeling spread in the 1990s with North America and Europe being exposed to Gundam through television, video and manga.</h3>
        <h3>The plastic parts are delivered in the exact form they exit the injection molding machine, on a "sprue tree" - a grid of interconnecting plastic rods, called runners, created by the channels in the mold that carried the molten plastic into the cavities that create each part. Each part is connected to the runners by a small plastic nub called a "gate" where the runner connected to the cavity.
        The kit builder must cut away this excess plastic - usually with a pair of side cutting pliers - to free each part, then (optionally, but usually) clip, carve or sand away the remaining plastic tip where the gates attached to leave a clean surface.</h3>
        <h3>Once the parts have been freed, the builder must then snap them together to assemble the model. Early kits required glue, but from the late 80s onward all kits assemble without special tools or materials.</h3>
        <h3>When it comes time to assemble the panels making up the external appearance of the model, the builder may choose to customize the model in a wide variety of ways.[12] The most basic is simply to paint the model, which allows for a large amount of personal creativity. Applying decals is also a common technique - decals are included with most models, but are also available as separate products for customization.</h3>
        <h2>Modifications</h2>
        <h3><bold>Panel Lining:</bold>  Many models have grooves where "panels" meet. Applying paint or ink with a fine tipped brush or pen can make these lines "pop"</h3>
        <h3><bold>Panel Line Scribing:</bold>  If the panel lines on a model are not as deep as the builder would like, they can use a knife to deepen them, or create new ones, using a ruler or custom stencil.</h3>
        <h3><bold>Weathering:</bold>  A variety of paint and plastic etching and carving techniques can make the model appear worn or battle-damaged, exposing simulated metal beneath the surface of an actual mobile suit's paint.</h3>
        <h3><bold>Kitbashing:</bold>   Kitbashes combine parts from multiple kits to create a unique new model.</h3>
        <h3><bold>Conversion Kit</bold>    Conversion kits are (often) third-party products, usually made of thermoset resin, which can be attached (usually glued) to an official Bandai model to convert it into another model using the original as a base. Bandai used to release official conversion kits under the brand name B-Club.</h3>
        <h3><bold>Custom Parts</bold>    At the extreme end, a skilled builder can create additional parts completely from scratch to add detail to the model. these can be purely aesthetic, enhance the articulation of a model, or introduce new gimmicks to a kit.</h3>

            <h2>I. SD - Super Deformed - Scale: Undeterminable</h2>
            <h3>Super Deformed Gundam or SD Gundam originated from a contributed illustration of a junior high school student from Nagoya by the name of Koji Yokoi to the "Model News" magazine that Bandai was issuing in the 1980s. The illustration is of a Gundam but with the weird proportion where the overall height of the Gundam is equal to 2 of its heads. This illustration interested the chief editor and so leading to Koji Yokoi serializing SD Gundam in 4 frame comics in "Model News".</h3>
            <h3>The super deformed designs were suitable for capsule toys and so they were first merchandised as small SD Gundam-shaped erasers as part of the Gashapon series SD Gundam World in 1985. Built with a hole so they could be skewered into a pencil, the series was a hit with Japanese schoolchildren and the concept soon expanded to other forms of merchandising and media, including gunpla, manga, trading cards, anime and video games.</h3>
            <h3>Features:</h3>
            <h4>Easy to build</h4>
            <h4>Cheap compared to other grades</h4>
            <h4>Lots of stickers</h4>
            <h4>Limited articulation</h4>
<br>
            <h2>II. HG - High Grade - Scale: 1/144</h2>
            <h3>HG models were introduced in 1990. The original kits featured full snap-fit assembly, an articulated internal frame (for the first two kits, which provides better range of motion and is more poseable), and utilized the molding technique known as System Injection, wherein multiple colors would be cast on the same part. In 1999, the High Grade Universal Century Line was introduced, which collected mobile suits from the Universal Century Timeline. In 2010, the line was expanded to include mobile suits from Future Century, After Colony, After War, Correct Century, and Cosmic Era, and Gundam series that did not fit in those timeline (Like Gundam AGE or Iron Blooded Orphans) received their own HG lines. In 2015, HG Revive, a subline within the HGUC line was introduced, which gave older HGUC kits redesigns that adhered to modern HG standards in terms of detail and articulation. The High Grade line is not exclusive to Gundam, as other mecha series, such as Mazinger, Kyokai Senki, and Evangelion receiving HG kits of their own. HG Amplified IMGN was a subline introduced in 2022, which redesigned smaller robots with more humanoid proportions.</h3>
            <h3>The text under the "HG"  indicates which universe the specific mobile suit is featured in. Sometimes, next to the "HG" is the logo of the specific series that the MS originate from.</h3>
            <h3>Features:</h3>
            <h4>Easy to build</h4>
            <h4>Good articulation</h4>
            <h4>Cheap compared to other grades</h4>
            <h4>Accessible and has a wide variety of kits</h4>
            <h4>Limited gimmicks</h4>
            <h4>Require Stickers for better color seperation</h4>
            <h4>No Inner Frame</h4>
<br>
            <h2>III. RG - Real Grade - Scale: 1/144</h2>
            <h3>In 2010, Real Grade (RG) was released to celebrate the 30th anniversary of Gunpla. Real Grade kits are differentiated from HG kits by a number of features previously found only in larger scale kits, including near perfect color accuracy without the use of color-correcting stickers, a full inner frame, high part counts, advanced articulation, and extensive decals. These kits have also been redesigned to appear more "realistic" by adding additional surface detail, color separation and mechanical detail. Most RG kits use a technology called the Advanced MS Joint, where the inner frame for the chest, arms, legs, and feet are prebuilt and fully articulated, requiring the other parts to be attached to it. Later RG kits have used the MS Joint more sparingly, limiting its use to accessories or specific limbs.</h3>
            <h3>Features:</h3>
            <h4>Great articulation</h4>
            <h4>Very detailed</h4>
            <h4>Has prebuilt innerframes for older kits, newer kits now has buildable innerframes</h4>
            <h4>Moderate amount of gimmicks</h4>
            <h4>Limited amount of kits</h4>
            <h4>Lots of small parts, thus makes many of them hard to build</h4>
<br>
            <h2>IV. MG - Master Grade - Scale: 1/100</h2>
            <h3>MG models were first introduced in the summer of 1995, designed and made to higher standards than most other models. These kits take much longer to construct and are often much more expensive than their lower-grade counterparts.[21] More recent Master Grade plastic models typically feature a movable inner frame system which enables extensive movement and bending of joints, as well as including standing and seating miniature figures of the pilots of each Gundam model.</h3>
            <h3>Beginning in 2005 with the Zeta Gundam and Gundam Mk-II, Older MG Kits would be redesigned under the Ver.2.0 moniker with features such as improved articulation and a full inner frame. The RX-78-2 Gundam has had multiple MG iterations, including a Ver.1.5 that uses a mix of old and new parts, a Ver.2.0 that is more faithful to the original anime, a Ver.3.0 that is modeled after the life size statue similar to the Real Grade version, and a version based on its appearance in Gundam The Origin. There is also a Ver.Ka and Ver.OYW (One Year War).</h3>
            <h3>The Master Grade line is not Gundam exclusive as a few Master Grade offerings have come from mechas in Patlabor and Dunbine. Bandai also released a line featuring a series of character figures from Dragon Ball Z, Kamen Rider, and Tiger & Bunny[22] under the name of MG Figurerise.</h3>
            <h3>Features:</h3>
            <h4>Easy to build</h4>
            <h4>Great articulation</h4>
            <h4>Very detailed</h4>
            <h4>Has innerframes</h4>
            <h4>Has many gimmicks </h4>
            <h4>Wide variety of kits</h4>
<br>
            <h2>V. Master Grade Ver.Ka - Scale: 1/100</h2>
            <h3>In 2002, a new line of Master Grade kits subtitled "Ver. Ka" was released, which are Master Grades designed by mecha designer Hajime Katoki. Mobile suits chosen to become Ver. Ka kits are chosen by annual fan votes. In 2020 a new line, Master Grade Extreme (abbreviated as MGEX) were redesigns of Master Grades that contained additional gimmicks called "Extreme Points". The first model kit of this line, the Unicorn Gundam Ver. Ka, contained an LED light strip that ran across the mobile suit. A second, the Strike Freedom released in November 2022 and uses metallic coated and plated parts for the inner frame.</h3>
            <h3>Features:</h3>
            <h4>Require skill to build</h4>
            <h4>Great articulation</h4>
            <h4>Great amount of details</h4>
            <h4>Lots of gimmicks</h4>
            <h4>Has innerframes</h4>
            <h4>Pretty expensive</h4>
            <h4>Older kits does not look good for out-of-the-box build</h4>
<br>    
            <h2>VI. Perfect Grade - Scale: 1/60</h2>
            <h3>PG is the highest grade line of Bandai kits. The first PG Gunpla kit was a RX 78-2 Gundam model released in 1998, but an Evangelion Unit-01 kit labeled as Perfect Grade released the year prior. Only 19 kits have been released as 1/60 Perfect Grade since then. A Perfect Grade Millennium Falcon kit released in 2017 and was 1/72 scale instead of 1/60 scale. The first PG Unleashed kit was a RX 78-2 Gundam model released in December 2020.</h3>
            <h3>As the name suggests, Perfect Grade gunpla kits attempt to represent the Gundam as perfectly as possible within real world and design limitations. These limitations result in the Perfect Grade line sometimes taking several years between releases to wait for advances in model making technology. Perfect Grade Unleashed is an updated version of Perfect Grade that uses more advanced technology and concepts, such as the return of Advanced MS Joints, the use of LEDs and Metallic stickers, multiple points of articulation in the same limb, and the Evolution Link System, where the construction is separated into multiple phases (starts with the bare inner frame, then the extra detail within the frame with metallic parts, then the armor attached to the frame) to simulate building a real mecha, with the final phase displaying the detail of the inner frame using multiple hatches.</h3>
            <h3>Features like metal joints, increased detail in plastic molding and plastic quality, as well as LED lighting kits are signatures of the PG line.</h3>
            <h3>Features:</h3>
            <h4>Metal Joints</h4>
            <h4>LED Lighting Kits</h4>
            <h4>Great amount of gimmicks</h4>
            <h4>Great articulation</h4>
            <h4>Great detail</h4>
            <h4>Has innerframes</h4>
            <h4>Very Expensive</h4>
            <h4>Limited number of kits</h4>
