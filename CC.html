            <h2>∀ Gundam (CC 2345)</h2>
            <p>∀ Gundam (∀ガンダム Tān'ē Gandamu?, called Turn "A" Gundam) is a 1999 anime television series created by Yoshiyuki Tomino, who returned after leaving Sunrise following Mobile Suit Victory Gundam. It aired on on Japan's FNN networks and the anime satellite television network, Animax, created for the Gundam Big Bang 20th Anniversary celebration. It was also compiled into two feature-length movies titled ∀ Gundam I: Earth Light and ∀ Gundam II: Moonlight Butterfly.
                ∀ Gundam is also the last of the Gundam metaseries (not counting the compilations and future video game cut scenes) to be hand painted on cels. 2002's Gundam SEED was the first series to use digital coloring.
                On July 22, 2010, Bandai Entertainment announced that they had acquired the license to release Turn A Gundam in the United States, but in 2012, Bandai Entertainment announced that they were stopping production, and distribution, of anime thereof, and that included Turn A Gundam. However, following the partnering of Sunrise and RightStuf Inc., it was announced that the series would be released on DVD on June 30, 2015, and it is currently also available for order on Blu-Ray Disc.</p>
            <p>For two thousand years, a separate race of humanity has lived on the moon. Known as "the Moonrace," their technology is leaps and bounds beyond those that stayed behind on the Earth's surface. Now seeking to return to their original home, the Moonrace send three teenagers – Loran, Keith, and Fran – down to Earth on a reconnaissance mission to test the viability of its environment. After spending a year on Earth, Loran has become good friends with Sochie and Kihel, daughters of the prestigious Heim family, and he looks forward to fully integrating into Earth society. But before Loran gets the chance to make his report, the Moonrace launch a surprise attack. Earth's primitive airplanes are no match for the superior power of the Moonrace's mobile suits. However, in the midst of the initial attack, Loran and Sochie uncover a long-forgotten relic: a white mobile suit. As a Moonrace, Loran is quickly able to grasp the basics of piloting it, but by doing so, he inadvertently places himself in the middle of a war.[3]</p>
