            <h2>Mobile Suit Gundam SEED (CE 71)</h2>
            <p>Mobile Suit Gundam SEED (機動戦士ガンダムSEED Kidō Senshi Gandamu Shīdo?) is a 2002 anime television series created by Sunrise. It aired in Japan from October 5, 2002 to September 27, 2003 at 6:00p.m. on the JNN TV stations (Tokyo Broadcasting System (TBS TV), Mainichi Broadcasting System (MBS TV, producing TV station), etc.).

            <p>In the year 70 C.E., the war between the PLANT and the Earth Alliance intensified when nuclear missiles were fired at the Junius Seven agricultural plant. The war, which was expected to end in victory for the Alliance, who had the advantage in terms of quantity, has been in a stalemate for 11 months.
            In the year C.E. 71, Kira Yamato, a young Coordinator majoring in engineering, lives peacefully in the colony Heliopolis in the neutral nation of Orb. However, within the colony, the Alliance is secretly developing five MS and building a new battleship, and upon receiving this information, the ZAFT Le Creuset Team begins a unilateral operation to seize them. Kira's daily life changes drastically, and the colony is transformed into a battlefield. As Kira flees, he arrives at the MS factory and is confronted by a fierce firefight between Alliance and ZAFT soldiers. One of them was his childhood best friend, Athrun Zala.
            With ZAFT having stolen four of the prototypes, Kira takes the GAT-X105 Strike Gundam and is forced to fight his old friend Athrun Zala. Little do they know that there are sinister forces at work that go far beyond their worst nightmares.</p>

            <h2>Mobile Suit Gundam SEED Astray(CE 71)</h2>
            <p>Mobile Suit Gundam SEED Astray (機動戦士ガンダムSEED ASTRAY, Kidō Senshi Gundam SEED ASTRAY) is a side story manga set in the Cosmic Era timeline that takes place concurrently with Mobile Suit Gundam SEED. It is the first of the SEED Astray series.
            Whereas the main story of Gundam SEED focuses on the struggles between the Earth Alliance, ZAFT, and Orb Union, the Astray series is focused on the three MBF-P mobile suit prototypes and their respective pilots and organizations, who mainly exist on the outskirts of the main SEED storyline. The MBF-P02 Gundam Astray Red Frame is piloted by Lowe Guele of the Junk Guild, and the MBF-P03 Gundam Astray Blue Frame is piloted by Gai Murakumo of the mercenary group Serpent Tail. The third Astray, MBF-P01 Gundam Astray Gold Frame, is piloted by the primary antagonist of the Astray story, Orb nobleman Rondo Ghina Sahaku, and later by his twin sister Rondo Mina Sahaku.</p>

            <h2>Mobile Suit Gundam SEED Destiny (CE 73)</h2>
            <p>Mobile Suit Gundam SEED Destiny (機動戦士ガンダムSEED Destiny Kidō Senshi Gandamu Shīdo Desuteini?) is a 2004 anime television series directed by Mitsuo Fukuda. It is a sequel set two years after the events of Mobile Suit Gundam SEED and the second Gundam series to be set in the Cosmic Era timeline.
            The series had its premiere broadcast in Japan on October 9, 2004 at 6:00p.m. on the JNN TV stations (Tokyo Broadcasting System (TBS TV), Mainichi Broadcasting System (MBS TV, producing TV station), etc.) and ended October 1, 2005.
            On January 29, 2005, a television special, Mobile Suit Gundam SEED Destiny EDITED[1], was exhibited between episodes 15 and 16. This special was a summary narrated by the voice actor of Sai Argyle, Tetsu Shiratori. The song Fields of Hope was used as an insert song. This special was never sold or included in any physical media distribution.
            On December 25, 2005, a television special, Mobile Suit Gundam SEED Destiny Final Plus: The Chosen Future, aired featuring an extended ending of the series.
            Just like the previous two Gundam series. An english dub produced by the Ocean Group aired in Canada on YTV From March 29, 2007 to March 28, 2008.
            After the airing of the final episode of the HD Remastered Mobile Suit Gundam SEED, the HD Remaster of Gundam SEED Destiny was quickly announced.[2]
            On March 2013, the airing of the HD Remaster began. Like the HD Remaster of Gundam SEED, the remaster of this series not only improves the animation, but also alters lines and scenes from the original, as well as introducing brand new mobile suits. The episode count for the remaster was 50 episodes. The recap episode "Refrain" was completely omitted from the HD Remaster, while the final episode divided into two parts: "Final Power" and "The Chosen Future", based on the "The Chosen Future" television special, with additional footage.
            Much like with Gundam SEED, the HD version of this series is planned for an English release as well, with a brand-new english voice cast that will be announced in the future once the production of Gundam SEED has been completed.[3]</p>
