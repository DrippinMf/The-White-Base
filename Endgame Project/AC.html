            <h2>Mobile Suit Gundam Wing (AC 195)</h2>
            <p>Mobile Suit Gundam Wing (新機動戦記ガンダム Ｗ Shin Kidō Senki Gandamu Uingu?, lit. New Mobile Report Gundam Wing) is a 1995 anime television series created by Sunrise. It began broadcast in Japan on April 7, 1995 with the original English-language run of the series beginning on March 6, 2000 on the popular Cartoon Network's Toonami programming block in the United States, becoming the first Gundam series to be broadcast on American television.
            The successor to Mobile Fighter G Gundam, this series combined bishounen character design with more traditional real robot anime to great popularity.</p>
            <p>The story of Gundam Wing begins in the year After Colony 195 with the start of Operation Meteor, five disgruntled scientists' plan for revenge against the tyrannical OZ military organization for their oppression over the space colonies. The operation involves five young boys who have each been chosen and trained by one of the five rogue scientists, then sent to Earth independently in extremely advanced Mobile Suits, one designed by each of the scientists, known as "Gundams". Their mobile suits are called Gundams because they are constructed from a rare and astonishingly durable material known as Gundanium Alloy, which can only be created in outer space.
            The five Gundam Pilots — Heero Yuy (pilot of the titular Wing Gundam), Duo Maxwell (pilot of the Deathscythe), Trowa Barton (pilot of the Heavyarms), Quatre Raberba Winner (pilot of the Sandrock), and Chang Wufei (pilot of the Shenlong) — originally have no knowledge of each others' existence. On first meeting any of the other five, each pilot believes the others to be enemy pilots in new OZ mobile suit designs. Once the young pilots realize that they have the same objective of destroying OZ (and in some cases the same mission), they band together to help each other complete their goals.</p>

            <h1>True Operation Meteor</h1>
            <h2>Mobile Suit Gundam Wing Endless Waltz (Pre UC 196   )</h2>
            <p>Mobile Suit Gundam Wing Endless Waltz (新機動戦記ガンダムＷウイング ＥＮＤＬＥＳＳ　ＷＡＬＴＺ Shin Kidō Senki Gandamu Uingu Endoresu Warutsu?), sometimes known simply as Gundam Wing Endless Waltz is a 1997 OVA created by Sunrise set in the After Colony era. It is both a prequel and sequel to the Mobile Suit Gundam Wing anime. It is a sequel as it is a continuation of Mobile Suit Gundam Wing, but is also a prequel as it reveals details regarding the past of the Gundam pilots and the true objective behind Operation Meteor.
            Endless Waltz originally premiered in Japan as a three-part OVA in 1997, and was later released as a compilation movie in 1998 titled Gundam Wing Endless Waltz - Special Edition that included new scenes and changes to the score. It was broadcast on Cartoon Network in the United States on November 10, 2000.</p>
            <p>It is the year After Colony 196 and the battles between Earth and the colonies have ended. Treize Khushrenada is dead and OZ has come to an end. This gives birth to the Earth Sphere Unified Nation (ESUN) and the Preventers. Seeing they won't be needed anymore, the Gundam pilots (except Wufei) send their suits into the sun. However, this peace would not last, for a rebellion occurs on the newly completed colony, L3 X-18999. Led by seven year old Mariemaia Khushrenada, Treize's illegitimate daughter, the rebellion kidnaps Relena Darlian, now the Vice Foreign Minister of the ESUN, during a diplomatic mission to X-18999. As the Gundam pilots investigate further, they discover that Mariemaia is merely a puppet controlled by her grandfather Dekim Barton, a former advisor to martyred colony leader Heero Yuy, who is using X-18999 to go through with the original Operation Meteor, as a contingency plan in case the ESUN doesn't comply. The Gundam pilots must prevent Dekim from seizing power over the ESUN. The Gundams are retrieved from their course to sun to Earth's orbit thanks to Quatre and the Maganacs. The pilots use their Gundams one last time to fight against Dekim's forces, not killing anyone. In the end, Dekim is killed by one of his own soldiers, Earth and its colonies are at peace once again and all mobile suits (including the Gundams) are forever destroyed.</p>
