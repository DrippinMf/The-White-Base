            <p>Mobile Suit Gundam AGE (機動戦士ガンダムAGE Kidō Senshi Gandamu AGE?) is a 2011 anime television series. It is a collaboration between Sunrise and video game developer Level 5. The series is directed by Susumu Yamaguchi and premiered on Japan's MBS and TBS stations on October 9, 2011.

An English dub of this show has also had its first overseas TV broadcast premiered in MediaCorp's Okto Channel in Singapore on 16 June 2012.[1] On August 25th, 2012, it was confirmed in the magazine "Kadokawa Shoten's Gundam Ace" that Gundam AGE would come to an end after the 49th episode to be aired on September 23, 2012. Also, the last four episode titles and summaries were released.</p>
            <p>Mobile Suit Gundam AGE takes place over the course of a century that encompasses the "One Hundred Years War". Mankind had migrated to space colonies several centuries ago, with wars on Earth having long ended. Suddenly, during the Advanced Generation (AG) Year 101 an Unknown Enemy (UE) appears and starts to attack Earth and colonies starting a full-scale war. They destroy the space colony "Angel" in a disaster later referred to as "The Day the Angel Fell". In AG 108, the UE attack a once peaceful colony known as "Orvan". Flit Asuno, a seven-year-old boy at the time, had his mother killed in this attack. Before she died, she gave him the Asuno family heirloom—the "AGE Device " memory unit. Using plans hidden within this unit, Flit begins to develop the mobile suit "Gundam", humanity's last hope.</p>
