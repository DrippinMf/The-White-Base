    <h1>Mobile Suit Gundam 0080: War in the Pocket (UC 0080)</h1>
    <p>Mobile Suit Gundam 0080: War in the Pocket (機動戦士ガンダム0080 ポケットの中の戦争 Kidō Senshi Gandamu 0080 Poketto no Naka no Sensō?) is a 6-episode OVA Series, the first of its kind for Gundam. It also marked the first time anyone other than creator, Yoshiyuki Tomino, was given a chance to direct a Gundam story. Released in 1989, it served to commemorate Gundam's ten-year anniversary. As suggested by its subtitle, "War in the Pocket," it is a small, personal story; a side story focusing on the experiences of a ten-year-old boy during the One Year War.
    Gundam 0080 also began an enduring tradition of retroactive redesigns. Yutaka Izubuchi updated the original Mobile Suit Gundam's dated mechanical designs and costumes, and since then every new creative team has offered its own take on the classic Gundam props.
    Not being penned by Tomino, Gundam 0080 also marked a significant departure from the constant background theme of Newtypes featured in the Universal Century Gundam universe, from the original Mobile Suit Gundam until Char's Counterattack. The absence of this theme raised the series' appeal towards audiences without special liking of Gundam or Tomino's work, and would continue in many following Gundam stories' narrations about ordinary soldiers and people in these conflicts.
    The character designer for this series was Haruhiko Mikimoto.</p>
    <p>December, Universal Century 0079. Zeon intelligence has identified a prototype Federation Gundam under development in a Federation base in the Arctic. The Cyclops Team, an elite Zeon MS commando team, is dispatched to destroy the prototype, but before they can accomplish their mission, the Gundam is launched into space.
    When the Gundam turns up in a Federation R&D base inside the neutral space colony Side 6, the Principality launches a covert operation to destroy the Gundam. When the raid fails, the Zeon prepares to launch a nuclear strike against the colony as punishment for siding with the Federation, unless the last remaining commando can eliminate the Gundam.</p>

    <h1>Operation Stardust</h1>
    <br>
    <h2>Mobile Suit Gundam 0083: Stardust Memory (UC 0083)</h2>
    <p>Mobile Suit Gundam 0083: Stardust Memory is a 13-episode OVA series set in the Universal Century. The characters were designed by Toshihiro Kawamoto. The series serves as a sequel to Mobile Suit Gundam and a prequel to the events of Mobile Suit Zeta Gundam.
    The first volume containing two 30-minute episodes was released in Japan on May 23, 1991. Subsequent volumes, containing one 30-minute episode each, followed every one or two months; the final volume went on sale on September 24, 1992. The series was directed by Mitsuko Kase (1–7) and Takashi Imanishi (8–13).</p>
    <p>Universal Century 0083: Zeon intelligence has identified a prototype Gundam designed for nuclear attack under development by Anaheim Electronics. A former Zeon ace and a small band of Principality soldiers are dispatched to Earth to capture the Gundam as part of Operation Stardust. When the Zeon successfully make off with the prototype, the Earth Federation assigns the mobile suit carrier Albion to locate and recover the missing unit. When the stolen Gundam fires at the space fortress Konpei Island, the Federation Space Force suffers a catastrophic loss. As the Federation regroups, they learn that the Zeon have captured a space colony, Side 7, ostensibly with the objective of colliding it with the moon. When the colony's course is unexpectedly changed toward Earth, the true objective of Operation Stardust is revealed.
    The series ends with the creation of the Titans, an elite Zeon-hunting division of the Federal Forces, and the main antagonists in Zeta Gundam.</p>

    <h1>The Gryps Conflict</h1>
    <h2>Mobile Suit Zeta Gundam (UC 0087)</h2>
    <p>Mobile Suit Zeta Gundam (機動戦士Ζゼータガンダム Kidō Senshi Zēta Gandamu?) is a 1985 anime television series. It is a direct sequel to the original Mobile Suit Gundam.</p>
    <p>It is U.C.0087, seven years after the end of the One Year War. After the events of Operation Stardust, the Earth Federation establishes an elite counter-insurgency division called the Titans to hunt down the remaining pockets of Zeon remnants. The Titans become overzealous in their mission, start resorting to brutal methods to achieve their goals, and become nothing more than ruthless tyrants with an ambition to rule the Earth Sphere. Two anti-Titans resistance groups, the Anti-Earth Union Group (AEUG) and their Earth-bound counterparts Karaba (led by Hayato Kobayashi), form to unite the various existing small forces in the struggle against Titans. Their members consist of renegade soldiers of the Earth Federal forces, former soldiers of Principality of Zeon, and militia from space colonies. Most notable is Bright Noa, who returns as captain of the assault cruiser Argama, the flagship of AEUG space fleet, and Quattro Bajeena, who is really the legendary ace pilot Char Aznable, the "Red Comet".
    Kamille Bidan is a troubled civilian seventeen-year old from Side 7's Green Noa 1 colony. His personal resentment towards the Titans results in him joining the AEUG. Quattro takes Kamille under his wings and becomes his mentor. The series also sees the partnership and cooperation between Kamille and Amuro, and the tension between Amuro and Char. Behind the frontline, the resistance group AEUG and Karaba are supported by many companies on Earth and in space, particularly the moon-based corporations. Besides financial support, the lunar manufacturing giant Anaheim Electronics also provides logistics and technical supports for AEUG, including spaceships, mobile suits, and munitions.
    The series begins Quattro Bajeena raids the Titans military base in Green Noa 1 to acquire intelligence on a new mobile suit prototype, the "Black Gundams". Kamille, a hot-headed Newtype dissident, is caught up in the raid and helps AEUG steal the Mark-II. Eventually, he joins the AEUG, initially as the Mark-II pilot, then as the pilot of the new Ζ Gundam (made by Anaheim Electronics and based on Kamille's own design). Hayato Kobayashi and Amuro Ray meet up with them shortly after the AEUG descends on Earth to attack the Jaburo base but Amuro won't return to space. Both will stay on Earth with Karaba while Hayato's son, Katz, goes to space with Quattro.
    Things are complicated further as Paptimus Scirocco, a "contract killer"/mobile suit developer from the Jupiter Energy Fleet (who, unbeknownst to his government handlers, is an extremely powerful Newtype) executes his own plan. He secretly conducts a coup d'état and takes over the Titans as part of his ambition to dominate the Earth Sphere. The war between Titans and AEUG will soon escalate as Haman Karn, the true leader of Axis Zeon, joins the war as well, leading to a three-way war. In the beginning, it is not clear which side the Axis Zeon is, as Haman's cunning plan is to play AEUG and Titans against each other and take advantage of the damage from the clash between them.</p>

    <h1>UC 0088 The First Neo Zeon War</h1>
    <h2>Mobile Suit Gundam ZZ (UC 0088)</h2>
    <p>Mobile Suit Gundam ZZ (機動戦士ガンダムΖΖダブルゼータ Kidō Senshi Gandamu Daburu Zēta?, pronounced Mobile Suit Gundam Double Zeta) is a 1986 anime television series animated by Sunrise and directed by Yoshiyuki Tomino. It is a direct sequel to Mobile Suit Zeta Gundam and the third Universal Century series to be made.</p>
    <p>As the continuation of Zeta Gundam, this series once again follows the story of the Anti Earth Union Group (AEUG) battleship Argama after Kamille defeats Paptimus Scirocco. To fight off the Axis Zeon, now called the Neo Zeon, Captain Bright Noa recruits a group of teenage junk collectors led by the loudmouthed but powerful Newtype Judau Ashta to pilot the Argama's mobile suits. Now sporting a line up of the behemoth MSZ-010 Double Zeta Gundam and the returning MSZ-006 Zeta Gundam, RX-178 Gundam Mk-II and Gundam-like MSN-00100 Hyaku Shiki, the group is nicknamed the Gundam Team. As such, this became the first of a number of Gundam series where a team of Gundam mobile suits fight alongside each other regularly. The climax takes place at Side 3 in the Battle of Axis.
    Out of the major Zeta Gundam characters, only recurring captain Bright Noa and Axis leader Haman Karn make more than cameo appearances in ZZ; Char Aznable's planned appearance was canceled when Tomino was given the go-ahead to do the Mobile Suit Gundam: Char's Counterattack movie. Yoshiyuki Tomino's original plan for the show which involved Char's return was neither revealed, nor does Tomino himself remember it. Aside from the openings, Amuro Ray does not make an appearance in the series either.</p>

    <h1>Char's Rebellion</h1>
    <h2>Mobile Suit Gundam: Char's Counterattack</h2>
    <p>Mobile Suit Gundam: Char's Counterattack
    Mobile Suit Gundam: Char's Counterattack (機動戦士ガンダム 逆襲のシャア Kidō Senshi Gandamu: Gyakushū no Shā?) is an anime movie set in the primary Universal Century timeline of Gundam, taking place in UC 0093.
    Making its theatrical debut on March 12, 1988, Char's Counterattack is the final culmination of the original saga begun in Mobile Suit Gundam and continued through Mobile Suit Zeta Gundam and Mobile Suit Gundam ZZ, marking the final conflict of the fourteen-year rivalry between Char Aznable and Amuro Ray, and the end of the EF/Zeon conflicts. The movie is based on the novel by Yoshiyuki Tomino.
    In addition to being the first original Gundam theatrical release, Char's Counterattack was also the first Gundam production to make use of computer graphics during a five-second shot of a colony rotating serenely in space.
    Char's Counterattack made its American debut on January 4, 2003 at 11 p.m. on Cartoon Network's Adult Swim.</p>
