            <h2>Mobile Fighter G Gundam (FC 60)</h2>
            <p>Mobile Fighter G Gundam (機動武闘伝Gガンダム Kidō Butōden Ji Gandamu?), also known as Mobile Fighting Legend G Gundam, is a 1994 anime television series created by Sunrise under the direction of Yasuhiro Imagawa. It was the first series in the Gundam franchise not set in the Universal Century timeline, being set in the Future Century timeline instead.</p>
            <p>In the Future Century (F.C.), humans have ruined the Earth. Much of mankind has abandoned Earth for space colonies, with each country on Earth having a corresponding space colony. Instead of having wars, a "Gundam Fight" is held every four years, where a representative will pilot a Mobile Fighter and compete with other Gundams until only one is left. The winning country is allowed to rule the Earth for four years until the next Gundam Fight.
            Dr. Kasshu builds the experimental Ultimate Gundam, whose purpose is to restore the Earth. However it is stolen by his son, Kyoji Kasshu, who escapes to Earth. As the 13th Gundam Fight begins, his brother Domon Kasshu is forced to become Neo Japan's Gundam Fighter to free his father, who was arrested and sentenced to cryogenic sleep following these events. He must also defeat his brother Kyoji and destroy the Ulimate Gundam, which has since evolved into the monstrous JDG-00X Devil Gundam.</p>
